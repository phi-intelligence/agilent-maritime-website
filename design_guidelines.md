## Marketing Page Visual Treatment

**Color Usage:**

## Critical Constraints
- Maximum 5 main sections per page to maintain focus
- Single viewport hero sections for immediate impact
- Glass-morphism effects should enhance, not overwhelm content
- Multilingual considerations for text expansion/contraction
- Professional maritime industry aesthetics throughout
- Accessibility compliance with sufficient color contrast ratios
